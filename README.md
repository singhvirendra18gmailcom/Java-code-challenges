String challenges 


this repository contains coding problems related to String abd their solutions.

Challenge 1) Print duplicate characters from String?
Challenge 2) check if two Strings are anagrams of each other? 
Challenge 3) print first non repeated character from String? 
Challenge 4) How to reverse String in Java using Iteration and Recursion? 
Challenge 5) How to check if a String contains only digits?  
Challenge 6) How to find duplicate characters in a String? 
Challenge 7) How to count number of vowels and consonants in a String? 
Challenge 8) How to count occurrence of a given character in String? 
Challenge 9) A classical coding interview question based upon String. You need to write a method like atoi() from C/C++, which takes a numeric String and return its int equivalent. For example, if you pass "67263" to the program then it should return 67263.
